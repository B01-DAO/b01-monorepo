        <h1>What?</h1>
        <p class='text-white'>
            AB01 is the first 3D generative onchain geometry, randomly created to resemble a
            potential habitat for the metaverse. Each AB01 is a non-fungible token on the Ethereum
            blockchain under CC0 license (link).

        <h1>Why?</h1>
        <p class='text-white'>
            AB01 is born out of a response to the lack of content land grabs of the metaverse and
            not so egalitarian nature of the flash minting model.

            <h1>How?</h1>
            <p class='text-white'>
                Each AB01 is generated from a randomized seed, which procedurally determines the
                parameters of the constituent parts to form infinite unique new configurations
                (design doc here). AB01 does not have pre-designed traits, each one is uniquely and
                equally rare.

                One AB01 will be generated every hour and auctioned off to the highest bidder for
                the duration of the next two years. With a total supply of <span

                (where all proceeds go to) to further the creation and development of democratically
                designed, owned, and operated virtual spaces.

            AB01 is created by a group of paper architects (wikipedia links), who will be rewarded
            in the form of AB01s periodically.
